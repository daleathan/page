<span id="id1"></span><h1>Rework<a class="headerlink" href="#rework" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>With version 4.2, I turned my attention to facilitating rework in
PAGE.  That is, how do you use PAGE to tweak the GUI without loosing
the supporting code that you have written? At the same time I want to
allow one to view the changes with the run command button in the
Python console.</p>
<p>Here is the situation.  You built a GUI and generated the Python file,
which created skeleton functions in that file.  You then fleshed out
the skeleton functions to support the GUI and then decided to modify
the GUI.  If then you again generate the Python code for the GUI, you
will have replaced the filled-out functions with new skeleton
functions loosing the code you wrote.  This is the rework problem: How
to save your hard fought code when reworking the GUI.</p>
<p>What needs to be done is to separate as completely as possible the
automatically generated GUI code from the added support code.  I have
made some changes that move in that direction in version 4.2.</p>
<p>My answer is to separate the generation of the GUI code from the
supporting code by placing the support portion of the automatically
generated code into a separately generated module to be imported by
the GUI module.  That is, now PAGE generates two modules, one for the
GUI and one for the supporting code complete with the necessary
linkage.</p>
<p>PAGE implements this schema as follows. Heretofore, a GUI built with
PAGE was associated with two files, &#8220;&lt;name&gt;.tcl&#8221; which is the file
suitable for input to PAGE, and &#8220;&lt;name&gt;.py&#8221; which is output of PAGE
containing the Python code for creating the GUI object and skeleton
functions and Tkinter variables utilized by the GUI. In the new scheme, the
skeleton functions and Tkinter variables are generated in the new file
&#8220;&lt;name&gt;_support.py&#8221; rather than in &#8220;&lt;name&gt;.py&#8221;.  A new item, Generate
Import Module, has been added to the Gen_Python submenu of the main
menu which generates &#8220;&lt;name&gt;_support.py&#8221;.  The new support file is
presumably only generated once and is where the bulk of the code
realizing the application is written. &#8220;&lt;name&gt;&#8221; is the application name
selected by the user when the system saves the &#8221;.tcl&#8221; or extracted
from the file name which may be supplied when invoking PAGE.</p>
<p>Thus, one may alter the &#8220;&lt;name&gt;.py&#8221; using PAGE without changing the
&#8220;&lt;name&gt;_support.py&#8221;.  Of course, if the user changes the GUI to refer
to new callback functions or Tkinter variables, then those will have to be
manually added to the support module. The style of the skeleton
functions and TK variable additions is pretty simple so that they are
easy to add manually.</p>
<p>Generation of either Python module will probably attempt to save the
tcl file and in do so may ask if you really want to save it. If you do
not answer &#8220;yes&#8221; the root file name may not be known and bad code will
be generated.</p>
<p>Let me repeat: You should only generate the support module once; otherwise
any code which you added will be lost.  Well, just in case you do that
inadvertently, PAGE will save some previous versions as backups.  If
you add new features specifying new callback functions or new Tk
variables you will have to add them manually to the supporting module.
Also, when saving the support module it will test to see if a support
module with the same name exists and if it does, it will question the
user as to whether he wishes to continue.</p>
<p>See the WCPE directory in the examples directory.  This is a program
that displays the program of WCPE which is one of my favorite
classical music stations.  In this example all of the functional code
is located in WCPE_support.py and the GUI is defined in WCPE.py which
is the main module.  I found it very tricky to deal with time zones
and did not want to loose any of that code and have to redo it or to
deal with diff&#8217;s ; at the same time, I was constantly tweaking the
GUI.  I generated the import module once and proceeded fill out the
init function and the callback functions in WCPE_support.py while
tweaking the GUI, i.e., changing its location, color, the size of the
display fields, etc..</p>
<p>Also, in the examples directory, you should compare the progress_bar
and the rework_progress_bar.  The directory rework_progress_bar
contains the changes that I made to the files in progress_bar to
conform to the new rework scheme. It may be instructive in that it
exemplifies an application comprised of two top level windows where
one of the windows accesses Tkinter variables in the second window.</p>
<p>With chagrin, I apologize to PAGE user for not having thought of this
solution to rework long ago.  Even though I have tested the idea with
several examples, some of which are included in the section on
examples, I worry that I have overlooked something big.  So if you
find any problems or oversights, please let me know.</p>

<div class="section" id="automatic-saving-of-modules">
<h1>Automatic Saving of Modules<a class="headerlink" href="#automatic-saving-of-modules" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>One possibly confusing aspect of PAGE is the saving of the three files
associated with a PAGE GUI:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>The tcl file which is the input to the &#8220;working&#8221; file of PAGE.</li>
<li>The Python code generated defining the GUI object.</li>
<li>The Python support file containing much of the boiler plate and skeleton functions.</li>
</ul>
<p>As stated elsewhere the root name is derived from the name of the tcl
file. The Python GUI root name is the same as that of the tcl file and
the Python support module is that root name concatenated with &#8220;_support&#8221;.</p>
<p>There are several mechanisms for saving. In addition as noted in the
last section, if one attempts to save a support module and one exists,
PAGE will inquire whether to con tine the save.  This is a feature
which might protect a manually coded module.</p>
<div class="section" id="save-command-in-the-menu">
<h2>Save Command in the Menu<a class="headerlink" href="#save-command-in-the-menu" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When File-&gt;Save or File-&gt;Save As is selected then the tcl file is
saved provided the GUI has changed since the last save action. The
previous version of the tcl file is made a backup file.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="save-button-in-the-python-console">
<h2>Save Button in the Python Console<a class="headerlink" href="#save-button-in-the-python-console" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When the Save button in the Console file is selected, the tcl file is
saved as above if there has been a change to GUI. Also, the content of
the top window of the Python Console is saved if it is different from
the last version of the code was saved.  That is, if the Python
console contains GUI code then the GUI module will be saved if it has
been modified since the last safe of the GUI code in the current PAGE
invocation. Similarly for the case of the support module being in the
Python Console.  The Python modules will create backups of existing
corresponding modules.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="run-button-in-the-python-console">
<h2>Run Button in the Python Console<a class="headerlink" href="#run-button-in-the-python-console" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When the Run button is selected the code in the Python Console will be
saved if it differs from the last save in the current invocation of
PAGE. This is necessary because the code is execute by invoking the
Python Interpreter against the saved file.  Running the Python GUI
code will show the actual GUI. If the Run button is selected then the
GUI program will be executed.  Obviously it will fail if there is no
support module.</p>
<p>The logic which I have implemented is fairly complex; I have included
below the code which is part of PAGE.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><pre>proc vTcl:test_file_content {filename new_content} {
    # Function to determine if we can safely skip the save function.
    # A return value of 0 means that we can skip the actual save.
    # A return value of 1 means that we must save.
    global vTcl
    set save 1
    set skip 0
    # If the Python file does not exist, we clearly have to save it.
    if {[file exists $filename] == 0} {
        return $save
    }
    # If we have edited the Python Console code window, we have to save.
    set modified [$vTcl(code_window) edit modified]
    if {$modified} {
        return $save
    }
    # If the content of the code window is unchanged, we can skip the save.
    if {$new_content == $vTcl(last_save,$vTcl(python_module))} {
        return $skip     ;# Skip the save.
    }
    # If we got this far then we want to save.
    return $save     ;# Do the save.

}</pre>
</div>
<p>Note that every time that the Python code for either the GUI or the
support module is generated the new module will include a current
timestamp and so comparing will two generations will always differ if
only in the timestamps. Without the timestamps I could probably reduce
the number of saves and backup files, but I think the timestamps are
very valuable.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="automatic-save-at-code-generation">
<h2>Automatic Save at Code Generation<a class="headerlink" href="#automatic-save-at-code-generation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When code has been generated by either Control-i for Control-p, the
tcl code for the GUI will be saved if it has changed.  Code for the
Support module is automatically saved also because it may not be the
case that one would attempt to execute that module for reasons given
above. The Python code for the GUI is also saved upon generation.</p>
<p>Prior to version 4.2.3, the Python code for the GUI was not saved
unless the user selected the Save or Run buttons on the Python
Console. For consistency, now both the GUI and the support modules are
saved upon generation.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="automatic-save-at-page-exit">
<h2>Automatic Save at PAGE Exit<a class="headerlink" href="#automatic-save-at-page-exit" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When PAGE is closed by either Quit, Control-q, or Control-c, the save
action is the same as for the File-&gt;Save.  Only changes to the GUI tcl
file is changed.</p>
