<h1>Examples<a class="headerlink" href="#examples" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Examples are the main way that I learned about Tkinter and how to
write code for building GUI&#8217;s .  Unfortunately, it is hard to find
examples.  Grayson&#8217;s book has been an immense help over the years and
more recently the pyttk-samples distributed by Guilherme Polo have
helped greatly.  The official Tcl documentation is pretty much limited
to man pages which are of minor assistance in getting started with
Tkinter. The <a class="reference external" href="http://www.tkdocs.com/tutorial/index.html">tutorial on the Tcl Developers site</a> only recently included
Python code. Much experimentation was required before I was able to
see a paned window on my screen or a scrolled directory.  There are
several interesting examples in the examples subdirectory.</p>
<p>Most of the examples have been reworked for version 4.2 to reflect the
rework scheme have a GUI module and a support module for each GUI.  So
one may experiment with the examples changing sizes, colors, fonts,
etc. in the GUI modules and they may still work if he does not
regenerate support modules.  At least, one can see some of the
possibilities.  Of course, I have created some of them like menu in
poor taste just to illustrate some of the possibilities.</p>
<div class="section" id="directory-browser">
<h2>Directory Browser<a class="headerlink" href="#directory-browser" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This example contains a scrolled treeview widget that displays ones
UNIX directory tree.  It is a rework of Polo&#8217;s example to include
folder icons which open and close.  Polo&#8217;s example is Based
on <a class="reference external" href="http://bitwalk.blogspot.com/2008/01/ttktreeview.html">bitwalk&#8217;s directory browser</a>.</p>

<div class="section" id="vrex">
<span id="id1"></span><h2>Vrex<a class="headerlink" href="#vrex" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>In the past I have used a number of regular expressions in Python and
used to great advantage <a class="reference external" href="http://laurent.riesterer.free.fr/regexp/">Visual Regexp</a> in composing and testing
those regular expressions and thought that rewriting the program in
Python would be interesting because</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>It would illustrate important capabilities of PAGE.</li>
<li>It would be a useful program in its own right. Indeed, I use it all
the time.</li>
<li>The original version was written in Tcl/Tk and so uses the regular
expression processing of Tcl which is bound to be slightly different
from that in Python. So an all Python version using the Python
regular expression processing would be true to Python.</li>
<li>The original program had ZERO documentation. I never could figure
out all of the facilities present. (The most recent version has one
page of documentation.) I wanted a version that I could document.</li>
<li>This example illustrates several points about PAGE support: Building
menus, using paned windows, text colorization, synchronization
between two scrolled text windows, and a project utilizing two windows.</li>
</ul>
<img alt="_images/Vrex_for_Python.png" src="_images/Vrex_for_Python.png" />
<p>The main portion of the GUI is a three pane window for entering the
regular expression and sample in the first two and the third pane
presents match results based on the selection of buttons at the
bottom.</p>
<p>Some of the features of PAGE illustrated in this useful program are:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Scrolled text widgets nested inside of label frames.</li>
<li>Use of two separate GUI&#8217;s, one for the main function of the program
and one for a help window.</li>
<li>Colorizing the text within the scrolled text windows.</li>
</ul>
<div class="section" id="operation">
<h3>Operation<a class="headerlink" href="#operation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Briefly, Vrex works as follows:</p>
<p>One enters the regular expression under test into the top text box,
and the sample which is the subject of the regular expression match
into the middle text box.  One may use the File menu to load files
into the text boxes, one may directly type entries or use the normal
cut and paste facilities of the operating system.  The user can also
save the regular expression and sample using the File menu.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Pressing the Go button causes the match to be attempted.  Also,
colorization is applied to both the regular expression and to the
sample. The regular expression is colorized to show the portions of
the regular expression are to extracted individually. And if the
match is successful the corresponding portions of the sample are
displayed in the same colors.</li>
<li>By selecting one of the row of buttons marked match, 1, 2, ..., 9,
the portions of the sample corresponding to extracted subpatterns are
displayed in the match window.</li>
<li>You can use the File menu to load to save both the regular expression
and the sample.</li>
<li>The Quit Button terminates the program.</li>
<li>The File menu also has a Quit entry that terminates the program.</li>
<li>The Help menu opens a second GUI containing a ScrolledText widget
which has help information.</li>
</ul>
<p>The regular expression should be colorized showing the portions to be
extracted in different colors and as well as the matching portion of
the sample.</p>
<p>If you then Select Match, that matching portion of the sample will be
shown in the Match text box. Select 1, and the portion matching the
sub expression will be shown, etc..</p>
<p>You can also load a file into the sample window and thus run the
regular expression against many strings.</p>

<div class="section" id="progress-bar">
<span id="progress"></span><h2>Progress Bar<a class="headerlink" href="#progress-bar" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This example shows the usage of the progress bar widget but is included
mainly for illustrating an application with two top level windows.  It
shows how the main window is able to interact with variables and
procedures in the imported module which actually displays the progress
bar.</p>
<p>Two versions of this example are included, the first in the
examples/progress_bar is the version that I wrote before implementing
the rework scheme and the second in examples/new_progress_bar is how I
changed the first to conform with the new scheme.  Important features
illustrated include the creation and destruction of the secondary top
level window and the fact that the main GUI support code requires
access to Tkinter variables defined and manipulated in the support
module of the other, progress bar, window.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="complex">
<h2>Complex<a class="headerlink" href="#complex" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This really isn&#8217;t much of an example doing nothing but does showing
nesting of a paned window inside of a paned window and a notebook
widget nested inside of a paned window. By the way, one can enlarge
the top level window and copy and paste the whole paned window to a
new location.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="menu-py">
<h2>Menu.py<a class="headerlink" href="#menu-py" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This just portrays a fairly extreme menu bar example.  Note, I do not
advocate this as a style to be used; it merely suggests some of the
things that can be done.</p>
<p>While this example works as expected on my Linux Mint 13 machine, it
does not work as well on my XP machine. The way it was conceived,
there is a small image to the right of the label in the left of the
menu bar. However, on XP neither the label nor the image is shown.
What one gets is &#8220;(image)&#8221;.  Strange since if you go down sever levels
there is an image to the left of one of the check buttons. I think
that is a problem with Tk.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="standard-tcl">
<h2>standard.tcl<a class="headerlink" href="#standard-tcl" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is just a top level window with each of the standard Tk widgets
that I support.  It just shows that I can generate working Python code
for each.   The lowercase &#8216;s&#8217; emphasizes that it doesn&#8217;t do much.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="themed-tcl">
<h2>themed.tcl<a class="headerlink" href="#themed-tcl" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>As above for the themed widgets.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="wcpe">
<span id="id2"></span><h2>WCPE<a class="headerlink" href="#wcpe" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>See the WCPE directory in the examples directory.  This is a program
that displays the program of WCPE which is one of my favorite
classical music stations.  In this example all of the functional code
is located in WCPE_support.py and the GUI is defined in WCPE.py which
is the main module.  I found it very tricky to deal with time zones
and did not want to loose any of that code and have to redo it or to
deal with diff&#8217;s; at the same time, I was constantly tweaking the
GUI.  I generated the import module once and proceeded fill out the
init function and the callback functions in WCPE_support.py while
tweaking the GUI, i.e., changing its location, color, the size of the
display fields, and change of some display fields from entry boxes to
labels.</p>
<img alt="_images/WCPE.png" src="_images/WCPE.png" />
<p>This example utilizes:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Labels linked to Tkinter variables to display information like times,
composer, artist, etc.</li>
<li>A Scrolled text box which displays the whole play schedule for the
day and colorizes the current piece and makes sure it is displayed
within the window.</li>
</ul>
<p>In addition I fuss around with reading and parsing web pages and time
zone calculations.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="clone">
<span id="double"></span><h2>Clone<a class="headerlink" href="#clone" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This is a somewhat kooky example located in examples/clone, where
main.py creates a GUI which presents a button &#8220;Make Two&#8221; which cause
the creation of two instances of the &#8220;called&#8221; GUI but with differing
characteristics of location and background colors.  The called GUI is
then able to create incidences of clones with different locations and
background colors.</p>
<p>It is also an example of passing a user parameter to the creation
module which is then passed to the init function in the support
module.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="calendar">
<h2>Calendar<a class="headerlink" href="#calendar" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Small example of building a calendar display using the new rework
scheme. It is located in examples/calendar subfolder.</p>
<img alt="_images/calendar.png" src="_images/calendar.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="cpu-info">
<h2>CPU Info<a class="headerlink" href="#cpu-info" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Another small example which displays the output of lscpu on a Linux
system.</p>
