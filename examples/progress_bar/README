	This is a small example showing an application with two toplevel
windows, main and progress_bar.  It illustrates how the main routine
imports the code for the progress bar, creates the progress_bar
window, and controls when the progress bar is advanced. 

    This is an example written prior to the rework changes in Version 4.2
