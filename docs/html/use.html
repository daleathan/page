<span id="use"></span><h1>Using PAGE<a class="headerlink" href="#using-page" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>Visual Tcl was conceived as complete build environment for Tcl. It
included facilities for managing projects with multiple windows,
creating of GUI&#8217;s, binding actions with callback procedures, creating
menus, writing functions, and testing the application, all the while
supporting many different widget sets and several geometry
managers. PAGE is limited to defining a single GUI window using Tk and
ttk widgets and the placer geometry manager; there are better
environments for building and debugging Python programs once you have
code for the GUI.</p>
<p>PAGE makes use of the Virtual Tcl facilities for creating a single GUI
window, assigning attributes to widgets, binding events to callback
procedures, and creating menus. PAGE also automatically generates
skeletal callback functions and supplies much of the boilerplate code
for running Tkinter.</p>
<p>When PAGE generates the code for a window, all of the code for causing
Python to create and map that window is generated - a Python class for
the toplevel window with all the code necessary to instantiate the
class (i. e., display the window), import statements, Tk mainloop and
initialization, a main procedure, etc.  Therefore, if you have
provided the skeletal callbacks the generated code is executable and
you can see just how the GUI will look in a Python environment. PAGE
even attempts to generate skeletal callbacks.</p>
<p>The generated code can be used as the skeleton for your application.
However, the generated GUI may be a secondary GUI and all that you
really want to do is instantiate the toplevel class, use support
functions implied within the GUI and possibly to destroy that window.
You can do that by importing the code as a module and invoking
functions within that module including automatically generated
functions for creation and destruction of the window. This will be
discussed in more detail later.</p>
<p>I often use the generated GUI classes as starting points for
customization. When you are not sure how to start or want to quickly
try out some GUI ideas, PAGE is very useful because it puts out all of
the boilerplate necessary.</p>
<p>PAGE is invoked by executing the &#8220;page&#8221; script located in the page
directory. I go to that directory and issue the command:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="o">./</span><span class="n">page</span> <span class="p">[</span><span class="n">filename</span><span class="p">]</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>I preface the command with &#8221;./&#8221; to be sure I am executing the page
script in the page directory.</p>
<p>PAGE can be invoked with zero or one file names.  If supplied the file
name should have an extension of &#8221;.tcl&#8221;.  If another extension is
supplied that is interpreted as an error and PAGE terminates. If there
is no extension given in the file name or the file name ends in &#8221;.&#8221; ,
an extension of &#8221;.tcl&#8221; is supplied by PAGE. If the file cannot be
found PAGE terminates.  If a file name is specified, the file should
be a tcl file saved during a previous PAGE session; it will be opened
as PAGE begins executing as an alternative to File-&gt;Open for
proceeding from a saved PAGE session.  Near the top of a &#8221;.tcl&#8221; file
created in PAGE there is a comment containing version information and
a timestamp. If that version information is not present then PAGE will
refuse to open the file.</p>
<p>As you use PAGE to build a GUI, you can save the current state of the
GUI at any time from the File-&gt;Save of File-&gt;Save As menu.  In fact,
it is a good idea to save your status often in case PAGE fails or
dies.</p>
<div class="section" id="overview">
<h2>Overview<a class="headerlink" href="#overview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This section attempts to describe the main functionality of PAGE when
building an application with a single root window. It will yield a
Python module which implements the application interface.</p>
<p>One uses PAGE to generate a GUI as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Start PAGE by executing &#8220;page&#8221; or activating the PAGE icon on
the windows desktop.</li>
<li>Bring up the new top window by selecting the
top left button in the widget toolbar.</li>
<li>Drag the toplevel window to where you want it.</li>
<li>Resize the toplevel window by dragging the corners or edges.</li>
<li>Change the title by changing the title attribute in the Attribute Editor.</li>
<li>Add a menu to the top level using the Menu Editor entered from
Widget-&gt;Edit Menu in the main menu.</li>
<li>Drag appropriate widgets from the tool bar to the toplevel window or
other previously placed container widgets.</li>
<li>As desired to make the generated code more readable, specify an
unique alias for the widget.</li>
<li>Adjust properties of the widgets and the toplevel window as desired.
Some of those properties will include specification of functions to
support the GUI such as to load list box, or to respond to mouse
selection, etc.</li>
<li>Use the function definition facilities to specify the necessary
functions and use the bind specification facilities to bind events to
functions.</li>
<li>When the window has the appearance that you want, select
Gen_Python-&gt;Generate Import Module A new window will appear and fill
with the skeleton functions and the definitions of the Tkinter variables.
Then select Gen_Python-&gt;Gen_Python from the main menu. A new window
will open and fill with the Python code.</li>
<li>Save the code and/or try running it.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Placing and Modifying Widgets<a class="headerlink" href="#placing-and-modifying-widgets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<div class="section" id="adding-widgets">
<h3>Adding Widgets<a class="headerlink" href="#adding-widgets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>All that is necessary to add a widget to the GUI is to select it with
Button-1 from the Widget Toolbar, position the cursor inside the
destination container and again press the Button-1.  A small version
of the widget will appear with its upper left-hand corner at the point
of the Button-1 click.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="aliases">
<h3>Aliases<a class="headerlink" href="#aliases" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Often algorithmically generated names can be difficult to understand
in computer generated code.  To reduce the problem in PAGE, users can
specify more easily understood names called aliases.</p>
<p>An alias is a user specified identifier of a widget in the generated
code. Obviously, aliases must be unique within the class which will be
generated in the python code to realize the GUI window. An easy way to
specify an alias is to select the target widget with a Button-3 click
and then select &#8220;Set Alias ...&#8221;.  Another small window will appear and
one can add the alias. Finally close that window by selecting the
&#8220;check&#8221; or with the Enter key.</p>
<p>Another way to enter an alias is to select a widget with Button-1 and
then select &#8220;Set Alias ...&#8221; from the Option menu in the main PAGE
window.</p>
<p>Also, one may specify an alias by selecting a widget and editing the
&#8220;Alias&#8221; field in the top section of the Attribute Editor.</p>
<p>An alias must be a legal python identifier.  PAGE does allow blanks
in an alias but they will be changed to &#8220;_&#8221;.  Also Alias has no
meaning for top level windows.  For top level windows the the variable
names are generated from the title attribute. There are numerous
schemes for generating such names but one that has been suggested is
based on CamelCase. It is:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Buttons could start with &#8216;btn&#8217;,  i.e. btnQuit, btnNew, etc.</li>
<li>Entry boxes could start with &#8216;txt&#8217;, i.e.  txtFirstName, etc.</li>
<li>Check boxes could start with &#8216;chk&#8217; I.E. chkDoThis, etc.</li>
<li>Radio Buttons could start with &#8216;rdo&#8217; or &#8216;rbtn&#8217;.</li>
</ul>
<p>Note that PAGE has an option so that PAGE will automatically generate
an alias.  This too is an algorithmically generated name but one that
is easier to live with rather that the default algorithmically
generated name.  This is controlled by a new field in the Preference
window. So you should be sure that it is correctly set and is not
overridden by a value in your &#8221;.pagerc&#8221; file. I recommend that you go
into Preferences, check the value and save the preferences.  Why the
original Visual Tcl program had two methods of generating names, one
comprehensible and one not and still chose the less readable one as
the default is baffling.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="selecting-a-widget-for-modification">
<h3>Selecting a Widget for Modification<a class="headerlink" href="#selecting-a-widget-for-modification" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For simple widgets like buttons or text boxes you can select the widget
either by selecting the widget with Button-1 in the GUI or in the
Widget Tree.  Then it merely a matter of dragging one of the attached
handles to resize the widget or dragging the mouse inside the widget
to change it placement within its container or parent widget.</p>
<p>With more complex widgets like notebooks, paned windows, or scrolled
widgets, clicking Button-1 inside the widget will select a child
widget rather than the whole widget.  There are several cases with the
complex widgets - moving the widget or resizing the widget, or changing
attributes of the widget.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>If you want to move the widget select it
with Control-Button-1.</li>
<li>To resize the widget select it from the Widget Tree with Button-1
and then grab one of the eight handles to resize the widget. There
are some tk binding issues that confuse me, so let me say that some
of these steps may result in moving the complex widget rather than
resizing it; the steps may have to be repeated.</li>
<li>To change an attribute, select the widget from the Widget Tree and
modify the attribute in the Attribute Editor.</li>
<li>To modify the pages in a TNotebook or panes in a TPanedwindow invoke
the menu with Button-2 in the Widget Tree, or the widget itself then
select the Widget submenu.</li>
</ul>
<p>When you select a widget, the Attribute Editor window will display all
configuration options available for that widget and the default values
of those widgets. I think it is clear how to modify most of the
options. One can easily change the colors, fonts, labels, text,
relief, and some that I don&#8217;t even recognize. Obviously, all of the
attributes are described in the Tcl documentation.</p>
<p>There are different ways to change attributes. Where there is limited
list of choices, the change is selected from a drop down list. For
colors one can type in the X color name, RGB in hex, or hit the little
button next to the field and a color selection window appears. Labels
and text fields can just be typed in. Where a command is to be specified, it
can just be typed in.</p>
<p>If you are working with standard Tcl widgets, there are many options
that can be modified whereas the ttk widgets have very few options,
their appearance being governed principally by the specified theme.</p>
</div>
</div>
<div class="section" id="cut-copy-and-paste">
<h2>Cut, Copy, and Paste<a class="headerlink" href="#cut-copy-and-paste" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>After much work I think that there is now a useful cut, copy, and
paste feature in PAGE.  The basic way it works:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Select the widget you want to paste in a new spot or container by
selecting it as you would for just plain moving it. If it is a
simple widget like a button you can just select it with Button-1 or
with a more complex widget try selecting it from the Widget Tree.</li>
<li>With Button-3 pop up the Widget Menu and select with Button-1 Cut
or Copy as you want.</li>
<li>Go to your Top Level Window, pop up the menu with Button-3 then
move the mouse to the desired insertion point and click Button-1.</li>
</ol>
<p>Copy and Paste are important features because one cannot drag a widget
from one container widget into another but one can cut or copy and
paste to get that effect.  For instance if one creates a button in a
top level window and then decides that it should be moved to a frame
or a notebook tab that cannot be accomplished that just by selecting
the button and dragging it to the frame. However it can be done with
cut and paste.</p>
<p>When debugging the this feature that I made fewer mistakes by
selecting the widget to be copied by selecting it in the Widget Tree
than trying to grad it in the top level window.  This is most
important when trying to select and copy nested widgets which one can
do.</p>
<p>I have implemented cut and it appears to work; however, I never use
it. There is a sequence of several steps between the selecting copy
from the menu and selecting the location of the paste.  If you get it
wrong following a cut, you can&#8217;t go back and retry the operation; the
source for the copying is gone. So, I stick to copy and paste and then
finish with a delete.</p>
<p>One thing that cut, copy, and paste cannot do is copy from one
module&#8217;s GUI and paste in another module&#8217;s GUI.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="widget-menu">
<h2>Widget Menu<a class="headerlink" href="#widget-menu" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Widget Menu, which appears in more than one place including the
main menu as well as the drop menu in the Widget Tree or a top level
window, provides a convenient way to modify some of the widget
attributes. The drop menu from the Widget Tree is seen below</p>
<img alt="_images/widget_menu.png" src="_images/widget_menu.png" />
<p>In the case above the menu allows one to easily specify the text
attribute and for specifying multiple line text labels.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="linking-events-to-actions">
<h2>Linking Events to Actions<a class="headerlink" href="#linking-events-to-actions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The point of building a GUI is to link actions (the execution of
specific code) to some event within the GUI like selecting a button
with a mouse key, typing a particular character into a text field, or
creation of a widget. These functions are termed callbacks. While
Visual Tcl and Tcl allows one to specify a block of code, one should
stick with a one liner in Python. One liners can be the name of a
function; just the name without a parameter list which will effect the
function call with a null parameter list. The other possibility is a
lambda expression to call a function and pass a parameter list.</p>
<p>Many widgets have a command attribute which specifies the code to
executed when the widget is selected with Button-1.  To specify that
command, one selects the widget and then shifts attention to the
widget menu or the attribute editor and specifically the entry filed
labeled &#8216;command&#8217;. Now you can type in the command or select the
button with the ellipsis. Doing the latter brings up a window where
you can type in the command.</p>
<p>If you want to invoke a function and pass parameters to it, you use a
lambda expression. Please see section 6.4 of Grayson&#8217;s book for a fine
explanation of the use of lambda expressions in this context. Let say
that if you want to call the function foo and pass it 3 as an
argument, what you enter as command is</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>not</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">foo</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">)</span><span class="o">.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Grayson talks about invoking callbacks directly or
indirectly. Specifying a command attribute is an indirect invocation
while specifying a binding to an event causes a direct invocation. The
difference is that the direct invocation passes an event object to the
callback.  The callback function must be an argument list which
includes a parameter for the event. To see examples of direct and
indirect invocation of call backs see the vrex example.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bindings-window">
<h2>Bindings Window<a class="headerlink" href="#bindings-window" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are many events that can be linked to code. See the Tk man pages
and Chapter 6 of Grayson. They include responding to the different
mouse button pressings or releases, a window getting or loosing focus,
etc.. If you want to link code to one of those events, open the
Bindings Window either from the popup menus in response to selecting
the widget with Button-3 or selecting the widget with Button-1 and
typing Alt-b.</p>
<p>Lets look again at</p>
<img alt="_images/binding.jpg" src="_images/binding.jpg" />
<p>On the left you will see top in blue the Tcl name of the widget and
below the name a list of the event to which the widget responds.  The
key action is to insert an action (really it is choose one of the
actions listed in the lower part). It is done by clicking Insert Menu
and selecting one of the actions there. As shown the action was
&lt;Button-1&gt;. Having done that, you are then allowed to type in the code
you want executed. Once again stick with a one-line lambda expression.
There is a difference here from what was discussed above in connection
with the command attribute, because when the event happens an argument
is passed to the callback which is the event object. This means that
the command is something like:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">lambda</span> <span class="n">e</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="n">foo_bar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">e</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">3</span><span class="p">,</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The parameter e above is the event object which contains much
information about the event. The object has the following attributes
(from the documentation found in Tkinter.py):</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">serial</span> <span class="o">-</span> <span class="n">serial</span> <span class="n">number</span> <span class="n">of</span> <span class="n">event</span>

</div>
<p>By using the Insert-&gt;Advanced you can specify specific keys, press or
release, and double or triple clicking, use of Alt or Control Keys. It
is a pretty extensive list.</p>
<p>One can quickly go beyond the common usages of bindings and that may
run into untested usage of PAGE. However, it has been possible for me to
build a number of useful applications using the facilities provide by
PAGE without encountering difficulties.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="defining-functions">
<span id="id1"></span><h2>Defining Functions<a class="headerlink" href="#defining-functions" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>If you name a function in a menu, an event binding, command attribute,
etc., then definition of that function is required before trying to
execute the GUI in PAGE.</p>
<p>Executing the GUI means to execute the generated Python code within
PAGE to demonstrate how the GUI will appear in the completed
application by selecting the Run button on the Python Console.  To
satisfy requirements of the Python interpreter named variables have to
be defined and if they refer to functions, those functions have to be
defined and of proper syntax.  Skeleton functions will be satisfactory
since at that state of development you really don&#8217;t expect the
application to usefully function.</p>
<p>One path for the user is to do nothing, letting PAGE create a skeleton for
you by just noticing that the a name is specified in a binding or an
attribute in the support module as described in <a class="reference internal" href="rework.html#rework"><em>Rework</em></a>.</p>
<p>The functionality described below is now, with version 4.2, considered a
deprecated function.</p>
<p>If you wish to have a more complete function then go to the function
list window which is usually open or can be made visible from the
Window menu. To create a function hit add. Yet another window will
appear filled with a dummy function, py:xxx. See below.</p>
<img alt="_images/function-editor.jpg" src="_images/function-editor.jpg" />
<p>To get a skeleton function just change the &#8216;xxx&#8217;s to the name of your
function and fill in the parameter list. If the function is to be a
class method be sure to insert &#8220;self,&#8221; including the comma as the
first parameter even if you have no other parameters. Obviously, you
can write as much of function here as you want.  For instance, I
sometimes will include the statement sys.exit() in a quit function.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">quit</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">sys</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">exit</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>An aside:</p>
<p>Since Tcl will tolerate a procedure containing anything until it
executed, PAGE will save your function as:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="c">## Procedure:  py:wet</span>

<span class="n">proc</span> <span class="p">::</span><span class="n">py</span><span class="p">:</span><span class="n">wet</span> <span class="p">{}</span> <span class="p">{</span>
<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">wet</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="p">,)</span> <span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="k">pass</span>
<span class="p">}</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>That means that later you can come back to PAGE to modify the GUI and
the functions that you saved will still be there!</p>
<p>I usually just let PAGE generate the skeleton functions, run the
resulting code to see what my window will look like and then do the
rest of my programming in emacs. If I want to go back to PAGE to
change my window, I save the functions that I have added into a
separate file which I later insert into my program after the GUI
changes.  Lately, I have been using the program Meld to facilitate the
copying of functions from one version of the application to another.</p>
<p>Since writing the above, I have implemented the rework strategy below
and am less inclined than ever to use the function definition
discussed above.  In other words, I just accept the skeleton generated
for the imported support module and go from there.  See the section on
<a class="reference internal" href="rework.html#rework"><em>Rework</em></a>.</p>
<p>Previously, the automatically generated functions contained only a
single &#8220;pass&#8221; statement. Unfortunately, that tell you nothing when you
try executing the generated Python code in the Python Console.  So I
changed the &#8220;pass&#8221; statement to a print statement which prints the
function name when the function is called. I have found that to be
helpful.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="menu-creation">
<h2>Menu Creation<a class="headerlink" href="#menu-creation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Menus can be associated with a Menu bar at the top of the window (see
previous section) or with a menubutton. A menubutton is a button which
when selected cause a menu to be displayed.  I should say that
menubutton support in PAGE is a bit more iffy than that for a menu
bar, perhaps because I use menu bars much more often than menubuttons.</p>
<p>There is a special editor for creating menus. It can be entered by
double clicking on the menubutton or from the attribute editor or from
the widget item in the main menu or a couple of other ways as well. Thus,
to create a menu associated with a menubutton, select a menu button
from the tool bar and put it on the window just like any other widget.
Then go to the Attribute editor and modify the attributes as
desired. From there, you can click on the menu attribute near the
bottom of the attribute window or double click on the widget itself.</p>
<p>The menu capability that I use most is the menubar at the top of a top
level window. To create such a menubar, select the window and from the
Attribute editor click on the menu option. That will open the menu
editing window. When creating a menubar, some of the items in the
menubar may be simple commands like &#8220;Quit&#8221; which invokes your quit
function. Others are cascade menus like File which
are sub-menu of items like &#8220;New&#8221;, &#8220;Open&#8221;, &#8220;Save&#8221;, etc. To
specify an action like the &#8220;Quit&#8221; example,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Select the &lt;Menu&gt; item at the top of the left field.</li>
<li>Insert-&gt;Command.</li>
<li>Select the entry &#8220;New Command&#8221;.</li>
<li>Go to the label entry on the right hand side of the editor and
change the label to Quit and hit the enter key.</li>
<li>Go to the command entry and enter the name of your quit command and
hit the return key.</li>
<li>You can change any of the options shown in the right window of the
Menu Editor, like background color, font, etc.</li>
<li>Images are added to the menu item by selecting the ellipsis to the
right of the image option and using the file open dialog to select
the image file.</li>
<li>Use the arrow buttons or Move menu to move the selection up or down
as desired.</li>
</ul>
<p>To put in a cascade menu like File,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Select the &lt;Menu&gt; item at the top of the left field.</li>
<li>Insert-&gt;New Cascade.</li>
<li>Go to the label entry on the right and Enter File.</li>
<li>Use the arrow buttons or Move menu to move the selection up or down
as desired.</li>
</ul>
<p>To add Open to the File menu,</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Select File on the left.</li>
<li>Insert-&gt;Command</li>
<li>Select &#8220;New Command&#8221;</li>
<li>Change its name as above.</li>
<li>Specify the command as above.</li>
<li>Move it up or down as desired.</li>
</ul>
<p>Of course, you can add cascaded menus to cascaded menus, etc..</p>
<p>When you are all done hit the Check Button on the right.</p>
<p>The menu editing window is repeated below:</p>
<img alt="_images/menu.jpg" src="_images/menu.jpg" />
<p>When adding entries to a cascade menu, that entry can be another
cascade menu. See the  reference to the example below.</p>
<p>When creating a menu for a menubutton, one can start by adding either
commands which is most common case or a cascade menu which leads to a
second level menu.</p>
<p>Some of the Tcl/Tk documentation for menus bars say that one should
only place cascade items in the menu bar.  However, I have found it
useful and intuitive to have all kinds of items in the menu bar.</p>
<p>I have modified the Menu editor to allow one to change various colors
of individual menu items as well as the fonts for individual items.
Then it occurred to me that one should be able to set preferences for
default values of menu fonts and foreground and background colors. I
have modified the Preference processing to do that.  I have not
allowed one to set preferences for active foreground or background
values. The net setting are in the Fonts and Colors tabs; in the main
PAGE menu go to File-&gt;Preferences...-&gt;Fonts or
File-&gt;Preferences...-&gt;Colors.</p>
<p>Points about adding images to menu entries:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>At this point Tkinter will only work with GIF and PGM/PPM images
from files. If for example, you have a jpeg you will have to convert
it one of the acceptable formats.</li>
<li>Also, when adding images to a menu and you have text as well, it is
necessary to set the appropriate value in the compound attribute
telling PAGE whether the image is to be on the left, right, top,
bottom or center.</li>
<li>The menu.py example does not work as well under XP as it does
under Linux Mint 12. Specifically, the image and label specified for
the left button of the menubar are replaced with &#8220;(image)&#8221;.  I
rashly think this is a Tk bug.</li>
</ul>
<p>I have included menu.tcl in the examples subdirectory to illustrate
some of the things that I have done to test the menu bar
facility. Load it, generate the Python and execute it. I wrote the
example to test the change in menu fonts and colors as well as having
several images and several level of cascaded menus.  I certainly do
not advocate using weird images, colors and fonts all over the
place. But you can.</p>
<p>I am uncertain about the best way to handle fonts in menus.  PAGE now
sets a variable that is used as the default menu font and that
specification is forced everywhere in the menu that is not specified
otherwise. However, once specified it is fixed. You cannot change it
without re-specifying it everywhere it is used.  I will revisit this issue.</p>
<p>The radio menu entry type has options &#8220;value&#8221; and
&#8220;variable&#8221; which need attention.  When a radio button is selected, the
variable is set to value. That is, if variable is x and value is a
then x is set to a, when the radio button is selected. The way the
menu editor works is that when a radio entry is added to a
menu, the label and value are set to &#8220;NewRadio&#8221; and the variable is set
to &#8220;selectedButton&#8221;. If you wish to use the variable setting then you
must change the variable to a different value, one you wish to
use. PAGE will change create the correct Tkinter Variable Class of
type string. It will also threat the value of the value field as a
string constant. Change that field to a value that works with your
application. Bare in mind that with radio entries in a menu they must
all share a singe variable.</p>
<p>The Check menu entry type has options &#8220;onvalue&#8221;, &#8220;offvalue&#8221;, and
&#8220;variable&#8221; much like radio entries.  The main difference is that the
check entry expects that each entry will have its own variable; they
are not shared.  Again, the PAGE implements the variables as StringVar
objects and &#8220;onvalue&#8221; and &#8220;offvalue&#8221; as string constants. The variable
stuff associated with menus can be bypassed by specifying distinct
functions in the command options or by passing distinct parameters to
the command function using the lambda function.</p>

<h3>Toplevel Widget<a class="headerlink" href="#toplevel-widget" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Toplevel widgets don&#8217;t really have a title property. It was added in
Visual Tcl and the Attribute Editor originally displayed it as one of
the geometry attributes. That didn&#8217;t seem like a good idea so I moved
it to the Attributes section.  The title is displayed at top of the
window and is used with &#8220;_&#8220;&#8216;s replacing blanks, as the name of the
generated Python class.</p>
<p>Among the attributes listed for a toplevel widget is &#8216;menu&#8217; which in
Visual Tcl allows one to easily create a menu in a menubar at the top
of the widget. Click on the attribute and follow the procedure below.</p>
<p>An improvement in version 3.5 was the ability to change other
properties such as the colors and the cursor of Toplevel widgets. One
property of Toplevel widgets is relief.  However, I was totally unable
to change that property at either the Python or Tcl/Tk level.  I
simply don&#8217;t know how.</p>

<div class="section" id="relative-placement">
<h3>Relative Placement<a class="headerlink" href="#relative-placement" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>Following the paradigm I am familiar with from VB, PAGE uses the place
window manager to fix location within the generated GUI.  Thanks to
George Tellalov, I decided to use relative placement for widgets
within the GUI thus allowing one to build stretchable GUI&#8217;s.  They
allow one to grab an edge or corner of the executing Python GUI and
change its size and while maintaining relative positions and sizes of
the internal widgets.</p>
<p>Since I don&#8217;t think buttons or labels should change size in step with
the change in size of the window, relative placement for buttons does
not change the size of buttons but the relative placement is
maintained.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tkinter-variable-classes">
<h3>Tkinter Variable Classes<a class="headerlink" href="#tkinter-variable-classes" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>With several of the widgets, it is necessary to have linkage between
tkinter variables and Python variables.  For instance, when one moves a
slider of a scale in the GUI window, he wants the value to be
reflected in a Python variable or conversely changing that variable
should change the position of the slider. This is done by means of the
Tkinter variable classes: BooleanVar, DoubleVar, IntVar, and
StringVar.</p>
<p>You need an instance of one of these classes. PAGE guesses the variable
type which you may need. You can then use the get method in python to
determine the value of the variable in tk and use the set method to
set the value of the tk variable.  There are examples below.  For more
information see the <a class="reference external" href="http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/variable.htm">Tkinter Variable Class</a> on the effbot.org web
page.</p>
<p>For instance if you are using a TScale widget to be coupled with the
tk variable variable &#8220;val&#8221;:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">set_Tk_var</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="c"># These are Tkinter variables used passed to Tkinter and must be</span>
    <span class="c"># defined before the widgets using them are created.</span>
    <span class="k">global</span> <span class="n">val</span>
    <span class="n">val</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">DoubleVar</span><span class="p">()</span>
    <span class="n">val</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">5</span><span class="p">)</span>   <span class="c"># Initial value to be displayed.</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>then you need to set the TScale attribute to &#8220;val&#8221;.  The rule is that
the Tkinter variable must exist before it appears in a configuration
statement like:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">che26</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">configure</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">variable</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">var</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When val is changed</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">val</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">set</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="mi">14</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>the TScale will move to that value.</p>
<p>If the TScale is changed in the GUI, you can read it with</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">val</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">get</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>PAGE tries to help out by generating an instance of the appropriate
global class variables as needed.  Again, this is skeletal code to
help the generated Python code run from within the Python Console. It
recognizes that a variable starting with &#8220;self.&#8221; is a class attribute.</p>
<p>If you forget to specify the variable then try to execute, the code
may give an error saying that a variable with a strange name is a
problem because a funny name is put into the variable attribute in the
Attribute Editor. PAGE tries to detect this situation and give a
cryptic error message.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="scrolled-widgets">
<h3>Scrolled Widgets<a class="headerlink" href="#scrolled-widgets" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>For some reason that I don&#8217;t understand, the Tk folks have never seen
fit to implement scrolled widgets such as a Scrolled Text widget. I
certainly don&#8217;t want to fuss around with all the separate programming
tasks required for build a scrolled text widget when building a GUI.</p>
<p>I am especially pleased that Guilherme Polo in his Pyttk-samples
package shows how to build Scrolledtext and Scrolledtreeview
widgets. Borrowing that code, I was able to include such widgets as
well as a Scrolledlistbox in PAGE . One can select a scrolled widget
from the Widget Toolbar and place it in the GUI and PAGE will include
all of the Python support coded necessary to realize the scrolled
widget. The scrolled widgets that I added are not named with an T
because they are not official ttk widgets. The Scrolledtextbox has a
normal text subwidget in which I have chosen to make the &#8220;wrap&#8221;
default &#8220;word&#8221;.</p>
<p>When the scrolled widgets are pasted into a container window, the
image shown does not display the scroll bars for two reasons. The best
is that the appearance is similar to that which is shown when the GUI
is executed because as implemented in the Python code the scroll bars
appear only when required.  The other is that I had a lot of trouble
with background colors in the ttk::scrollbars used in the Python GUI.
One can distinguish between the text boxes and scrolled text boxes
because I load the PAGE version with the word Scrolled.</p>
<p>These widgets are complex widgets, so to move or resize them, use
control with Button-1. The scrollbars are ttk::scrollbar widgets which
appear only when needed, i. e., when an item extends beyond the
allotted space.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tnotebook">
<h3>TNotebook<a class="headerlink" href="#tnotebook" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>If you select, place, and resize a TNotebook in
your GUI window it have display two pages and look like:</p>
<img alt="_images/notebook.jpg" src="_images/notebook.jpg" />
<p>To change the attributes of the TNotebook, select the notebook editor either
by invoking Control-Button-1 in the widget and then selecting edit
page from the Widget menu or by selecting it in the Widget Tree with
Button-3 and then the Widget entry in the popup menu.</p>
<img alt="_images/edit-pages.jpg" src="_images/edit-pages.jpg" />
<p>Here you can do all sorts of interesting things like change the text
in the tab and select the tab you want to activate for adding widgets
or changing attributes of widgets already added to that page. If you
got to the menu Item-&gt;Add, it will create a new page to the
notebook, in the above example, between Page 1 and Page 2.  The Move
menu as well as the up and down buttons will change the order of the
pages.  The move operation will move the selected page one position up
or down.  The move is circular in the sense that moving the bottom
item down will move it to the top, etc..</p>
<p>Another way of navigating the pages is the pages attribute in the
Attribute Editor.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="tpanedwindow">
<h3>TPanedwindow<a class="headerlink" href="#tpanedwindow" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The TPanedwindow can be added to the GUI by selecting it from the
Widget Toolbar and then Button-1 in the container. It can be moved
around by Control-Button-1 and resized by dragging one of the
handles. It is sometimes a bit difficult grabbing a handle unless you
select the TPanedwindow widget from the Widget Tree window. Each pane
of the paned window contains a filling TLableframe.  Using the label
frame was the only way I could find to actually get the a TPanedwindow
to appear on my screen. Again, I had few examples to work from.</p>
<p>The paned window is configured by invoking Widget-&gt;Edit Panes menu
item bringing up the following editor.</p>
<img alt="_images/edit-panes.jpg" src="_images/edit-panes.jpg" />
<p>This editor allows users to move among the panes, change the text in
the label frame, and to manipulate the position of the sash between
the current frame and the next one.    You can set the sash position as a
percentage of the total size of paned window.  Again, one saves the
changes by clicking on the green check.</p>
<p>With version 3.2, one can select the TLableframe defining the pane and
drag the edge of it to change the sash position. In other words,
select a pane with Button-1 and drag one of the interior handle; that
will move the sash between the selected pane and the adjacent pane.</p>
<p>The Edit panes window allows one to add additional panes to the window
via the Item menu. The implementation of paned windows sets the
initial size of the paned window to 200x200 pixels and the the first
pane size to 75 pixels.  Adding a new pane adds one at the end (the
right end of a horizontal TPanedwindow or the bottom of a vertical
TPanedwindow, in either case, taking space from prior end pane.
Fortunately you can resize the whole TPanedwindow which changes the
size of the end pane. Then resize the others by changing the sash
positions as described above.</p>
<p>The editor, by including the Move menu and the little up and down
arrows allows one can move the a pane to a new position. Again, the
move operation is circular.</p>
<p>I am still having a problem with resizing TPanedwindows. If you select
the paned window, by say selecting it in the Widget Tree window, move
the paned window, and then select and move one of the handles, the
TPanedwindow will move rather than resize. However, if you again
select a handle it will resize the window. Obviously, something has
been set but not reset.  As soon as I figure out how to correct the
problem I will release a new version.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="treeview">
<h3>Treeview<a class="headerlink" href="#treeview" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I have had real difficulty providing reasonably good support
for the Treeview widget.</p>
<p>What I have been able to do is to support the placement of the widget
in a window with a default of one column in addition to the tree
column. By invoking the column editor you may change many of the
characteristics of the widget such as the column size and heading, as
well as the number of columns. It also allows one to reorder the
columns.  Note that the column that contains the tree has the index of
&#8220;#0&#8221; and must remain the first (left-most) column.</p>
<p>When the widget is created or when a column is added the configuration
option &#8220;stretch&#8221; is set to 0 (not stretchable).  This means that the
widget will not behave as I expect when using relative placement and
the window size is changed when executing the Python code.  The
enclosing widget with the scrollbars will either have a blank area to
the right of the last column if the window is enlarged or the last
column will not fully show.  To get the more desirable behavior, go
into the Column Editor in the Widget menu and make at least one of the
columns stretchable.</p>

<div class="section" id="combobox">
<h3>Combobox<a class="headerlink" href="#combobox" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The combobox requires a list of selectable values.  These are most

invoked from the menu a scrolled text box appears and the values are
specified by entering them one per line in the text box and then
selecting the check mark.</p>

<div class="section" id="radiobuttons">
<h3>Radiobuttons<a class="headerlink" href="#radiobuttons" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>TRadiobuttons and Radiobuttons act pretty much the same. One specifies
several of the widgets which are linked by specifying the same
variable for all. It is necessary to specify a different value for
each radiobutton. One can also specify an initial value for the
group. For TRadiobuttons the values and variables can be specified
from the Widget menu as well as in the Attribute editor.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="strangeness-with-text-and-variables">
<h3>Strangeness with Text and Variables<a class="headerlink" href="#strangeness-with-text-and-variables" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I was surprised to discover a couple of strange things about the way
text is handled with Ttk widgets.  There are several Ttk widgets,
among them TButton, TMenubutton, Tlabel, TCheckbuttom, and
Tradiobutton, which have both properties of &#8220;-text&#8221; and
&#8220;-variable&#8221;. Using the Attribute Editor you can specify the value of
the Text to be displayed in PAGE when you are laying out the
GUI. However, if you then specify the variable attribute, the text
attribute is changed to the zero length string.  I guess that that is
because the variable you named is undefined.  But also the width of
the field containing the text may be set to zero length. So, for
instance, Tlables appear to have zero width unless you have changed
the width prior to specifying the variable.  A Tbutton merely displays
blank text and TRadiobuttons squeezes down to just the
button. TCheckbuttons behaves similarly to TRadiobuttons.</p>
<p>When you generate the Python code the widgets will again appear to
have no text and maybe have no width unless you have set a non blank
value into the Tkinter variable. Tk widets including Button, Message,

<h3>Listbox<a class="headerlink" href="#listbox" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>The Listbox widget has the option &#8220;listvariable&#8221; which one would expect to
behave exactly like one of the Tkinter variable classes.  However, the Tcl
documentation specifies that the listvariable must contain a list of
values to be displayed in the listbox and the possible Tkinter
variable classes are BooleanVar, StringVar, IntVar, and DoubleVar.  By
experimentation I have found that by specifying the var to be
StringVar and setting its value to a tuple of strings will cause each
member of the tuple to appear as an entry in the listbox.  I am rather
surprised at this but glad to find something that works.</p>

<p>Tk does strange things when one tries to modify the narrow dimension
of a scale widget (the height of a horizontal scale or the width of a
vertical one).  So PAGE does not allow one to modify the narrow
dimension during the design phase and restricts the Relative Placement

<p>Support for the ttk::sizegrip widget was included in Version 4.0.
Merely select the widget from the Widget Toolbar and drop it anywhere
within the Toplevel frame but not on top of another widget; it will
bounce to the lower right corner.  Were you to drop it on say a
notebook widget, a weird result would occur like landing in the wrong
place but doing the right thing.</p>
<p>I had difficulties with using Sizegrip with PAGE windows.  It works
fine with the Python Console and the Menu Editor, but I never got a
truly satisfactory result with Widget Tree or or the Widget Toolbar.
I left it with the Widget Toolbar but not with the Widget tree. To be

<span id="generate"></span><h2>Generating and Running the Python GUI<a class="headerlink" href="#generating-and-running-the-python-gui" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Once the GUI has been defined, the next step is to generate the Python
code which will realize the GUI.  This is done from the Gen_Python
submenu of the main menu.  This will generate a hopefully executable
Python module and display it in the Python console. Starting in
version 4.0, the generated code will contain comments with PAGE and
Tcl version information and a timestamp.</p>
<p>Beginning with version 4.2, the Gen_Python submenu is used to generate
two Python modules. &lt;name&gt;.py and &lt;name_support&gt;.py, called the
support module, as discussed in the section on <a class="reference internal" href="rework.html#rework"><em>Rework</em></a>.  The
intention is that all or almost all hand generated code will be in the
support module.  What happens on execution is that the GUI class will
be instantiated which means that the GUI will appear on the screen and
then control will pass to the init function in the support module
where the necessary code is written to support the function desired
with the GUI, i.e., the application.</p>
<p>As defined above, running the GUI means executing the GUI inside PAGE
to see what it will look like in the Python environment.  Remember you
have not build a complete application, just the GUI.</p>
<p>The generated GUI is written in such a way that it will run stand
alone as a script provided that you have all the necessary stuff
included. For instance, many of the widgets will have references to
command functions that need to be present at least in skeletal form
for the generated Python to run stand alone. They may also reference
Tkinter variable classes which must be defined for the Python to
execute.</p>
<p>Let me discuss the skeletal functions first. Function references may
be referenced in several ways. If the function name is given the
skeletal function will be created in the support module. An example
would be to specify the command attribute in PAGE as &#8220;George&#8221;. In that
case, the skeletal support function &#8220;George&#8221; would be created in the
support module.  If the specification were given as &#8220;self.George&#8221;, the
skeletal module would created as a class function within the GUI
class. Finally, if another module were specified as in &#8220;app.George&#8221;
PAGE would not create a skeleton function at all; your on your
own. From this you can see the need to create the support module
before trying to execute the GUI module.</p>
<p>Similarly, Tkinter variable classes are defined or the GUI class or in
the support module depending on the presence or absence of &#8220;self.&#8221; at
the beginning of the spec.  If specified in the support module, code
is included to insure that the class is created before the GUI
execution references the class.</p>
<p>I generally use this facility to see how the Python version of GUI
looks. To that end, the code is built with very minimal skeletal
functions in order to check the appearance of the GUI by running from
the Python console. The final lines of the module are:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">if</span> <span class="n">__name__</span> <span class="o">==</span> <span class="s">&#39;__main__&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span>
    <span class="n">vp_start_gui</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>which will call vp_start_gui when the the script is exercised. The key
is vp_start_gui which is generated automatically. It contains some
code like:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">unknown_support</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">vp_start_gui</span><span class="p">():</span>

</pre></div>
</div>
<p>The title above will be different depending on the title attribute of
the Toplevel window and, of course, the geometry will reflect the
location and sizes you specify in placing the toplevel widget.</p>
<p>When you select the toplevel widget and Generate Import Module from the
menu, the Python Console will appear, filled with the generated
code for the supporting module named &#8220;&lt;name&gt;_support.py&#8221;.  This file
will contain skeleton functions and Tkinter variables needed.  This is the
file to update to contain the principal code for the application. This
is generated automatically once per application.</p>
<p>When you select the toplevel widget and Generate Python from the
menu, the Python Console will appear, filled with the generated
code. You can push the run button and execution will be attempted.
This will automatically save the generated code into a &#8221;.py&#8221; file
where the root name matches that of the tcl file which is also
automatically saved.  When running in the Python Window, line output
from the GUI is directed to the lower window of the Python Console.</p>
<p>A final word about running in the Python Window is that the &#8221;.tcl&#8221; file
will be automatically saved as well as the python file. If no name has
been selected for the project, then a file output window will open and
you will be presented with a window with which to specify the tcl file
name, the root of which will be used for the python file name.  The
tcl file can be used as an argument to PAGE allowing one to later
pickup where he left off.</p>
<p>The function &#8220;init&#8221; is the place to initial things after the GUI
is mapped.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="applications-with-multiple-top-level-windows">
<h2>Applications with Multiple Top-Level Windows<a class="headerlink" href="#applications-with-multiple-top-level-windows" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Often the user will want to build applications which have more than
one top level window.  Since PAGE is built for the specification of
only one such window how does the user proceed?  I think that the best
approach is to create separate modules for each top level window and
have the main routine import them using import statements. The windows
can then be created using the create routine in the modules.  This
approach was used for the Vrex example above.  Here, I used PAGE to
build skeletons for two separate program modules, the main vrex
program and the vrex_help module, and coupled the two by having vrex,
the main module, import vrex_help and invoke the help window when the
&#8220;Help&#8221; button was selected with the statement:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">vrex_help</span>

<span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">help</span><span class="p">():</span>
    <span class="n">vrex_help</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create_Vrex_Help</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">root</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Of course, there is very little interaction between the two programs
which simplifies things in this case. As in the example below, the
argument &#8220;root&#8221; ties the help window to the main window.</p>
<p>The same technique was used in the progress_bar example which shows
more interaction between the windows including the control of the
progress bar window from inside the main routine. Here the two
modules are main.py and progress_bar.py.
In main.py we have</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="kn">import</span> <span class="nn">progress_bar</span>

<span class="bp">self</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">bar</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">progress_bar</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">create_Progress_Bar</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="n">root</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Here pass to the create routine the parameter root which ties the two
windows together and the create routine returns the Progress_Bar
object which allows the main GUI to access all of the functions and
attributes of the Progress_Bar object, in turn allowing the main GUI
to advance the bar and to close the progress bar.</p>
<p>Special functions are created in the python code to facilitate the
creation and destruction of the window.</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">w</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">None</span>

    <span class="n">w</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="bp">None</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Obviously, if one wants to pass parameters to the __init__ function of
the window, then one must modify the parameter list to the create
function above and to the call to __init__ in the above:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="k">def</span> <span class="nf">create_Progress_Bar</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">root</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">other_args</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span>

     <span class="n">w_win</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">Progress_Bar</span> <span class="p">(</span><span class="n">w</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">other_args</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="o">...</span><span class="p">)</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Also, one may pass a parameter to the init function in the support
module. This parameter may be any Python data type - ,integer, float,
etc., as well as lists, tuple, and dictionary.  So it is really a
variable length parameter list.  For instance, you might have code
like the following which I used in the <a class="reference internal" href="examples.html#double"><em>Clone</em></a> example :</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">p_dict_1</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span><span class="s">&#39;geom&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">&quot;+200+650&quot;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;instance&#39;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="mi">1</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s">&#39;color&#39;</span> <span class="p">:</span> <span class="s">&#39;firebrick&#39;</span><span class="p">}</span>

<p>When starting a section of code which is likely to be long running, a
busy section, insert the following at the start:</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">busyStart</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>When leaving a busy section make the following the last statement():</p>
<div class="highlight-python"><div class="highlight"><pre><span class="n">busyEnd</span><span class="p">()</span>
</pre></div>
</div>
<p>Obviously, an application could have numerous busy sections and they
might coincide with particular functions or not.</p>

<h2>Final Thought on Usage<a class="headerlink" href="#final-thought-on-usage" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When one feels confident in using PAGE, he looks at the code patterns
generated by PAGE and modifies the code for effects not anticipated in
PAGE. The philosophy of PAGE is that there is a large and intimidating
body of information needed to start building a GUI. PAGE encapsulates
that information and produces working code. At that point the user can
see the direction the flow is taking and can easily customize the
code at the python level.</p>
