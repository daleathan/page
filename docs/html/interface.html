<h1>The PAGE Interface<a class="headerlink" href="#the-page-interface" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>This section discusses the menus and several of the windows in the
PAGE interface.  Again, the PAGE interface is a modified version of the
Visual Tcl interface.  It was modified because some of the original
facilities and features of Visual Tcl are inappropriate for PAGE or
because the Visual Tcl documentation is in such a sad state that I do
not understand them.</p>
<p>Many PAGE parameters are are saved from one invocation of PAGE to the
next in the file &#8220;HOME/.pagerc&#8221;. Included are the preferences and the
geometry (size and location) of the various windows in the page
interface.</p>
<p>Start PAGE by executing &#8216;page&#8217; on Linux, winpage.bat in a DOS window,
or activating the PAGE icon on the Windows desktop. The page and
winpage.bat scripts may specify a filename. If the filename includes
an extension, it must be &#8221;.tcl&#8221;; in the case of no extension or a
final &#8221;.&#8221;, the extension &#8221;.tcl&#8221; will be appended to the filename.</p>
<p>The user is then greeted with a number PAGE windows and the main menu.</p>
<p>The default interface for PAGE presents small font sizes and the Tk
default scheme of black on gray. So for my personal use I made the
fonts larger and wanted the background color Wheat. See the section on
<a class="reference internal" href="preferences.html#preferences"><em>Defaults and Preferences</em></a>.</p>
<div class="section" id="menus">
<h2>Menus<a class="headerlink" href="#menus" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The main menu of PAGE contains some of the usual stuff and there is
nothing too surprising in the File, Edit, or Window menus.  There are
several PAGE windows which popup for various functions and the user
can relocate them and change their sizes with the mouse.  The Save
Window Locations item in the Window menu saves the current locations
for future invocations of PAGE.</p>
<p>The Option menu has the item &#8220;Hide&#8221; which &#8220;Withdraws a widget from
display&#8221;. Again, I have never used it. The other items are self
explanatory.</p>
<p>The Widget menu is dynamic depending on the widget selected. Commonly,
it allows the invocation of things like the Menu editor, or Page
editor for the TNotebook widget.</p>
<p>Finally, the Gen_Python menu creates the Python code for the GUI.</p>
<p>Let me emphasize that PAGE will contain bugs. So be sure to save
often. That is the purpose of the save commands in the File menu.</p>
<p>When PAGE starts for the first time, it throws up upon the screen a
jumble of windows to be discussed below.  You should move them around
to better locations, resize them, and then invoke Window-&gt;Save Window
Location and quit. The next time you start PAGE, they will be where
you put them. Of course this can be done anytime. Also, when you Quit
PAGE, the current window locations and geometries are saved as default
locations.</p>
<p>Many of interface elements like the Widget Toolbar, the Attribute
Editor, and the Widget Tree can be turned on from the Window item of
the main toolbar. Others are invoked from the widget menu after a
widget is selected.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="widget-toolbar">
<h2>Widget Toolbar<a class="headerlink" href="#widget-toolbar" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Widget Toolbar is where one obtains widgets for inclusion in the
GUI. One begins building a GUI by selecting Toplevel with Button-1 and
a blank toplevel window appears on the screen.  For other widgets,
click on the widget in the toolbar and then click in the parent.  The
upper left hand corner of the widget appears at the spot where the
user clicked.</p>
<p>The Widget Toolbar appears below:</p>
<img alt="_images/widget.jpg" src="_images/widget.jpg" />
<p>Clicking on the gray bands causes the corresponding section to
collapse or expand.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="attribute-editor">
<h2>Attribute Editor<a class="headerlink" href="#attribute-editor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When one selects a widget the Attribute Editor displays all attributes
of that widget.  The plum colored fields are not writable the others
are. For instance, the Attribute Editor shown below allows one to
change the title from &#8220;New Toplevel 1&#8221; to something more
meaningful. That field is used to generate the Python
class name for the GUI.</p>
<img alt="_images/attribute.jpg" src="_images/attribute.jpg" />
<p>There is the Alias field which is writable by the user.  The user can
provide an alias to improve the readability of the generated code.</p>
<blockquote>
<div></div></blockquote>
</div>
<div class="section" id="widget-tree">
<span id="widgettree"></span><h2>Widget Tree<a class="headerlink" href="#widget-tree" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Widget Tree shows all of widgets created by PAGE and how they are
nested within their parent widgets, see below.</p>
<img alt="_images/widget-tree.jpg" src="_images/widget-tree.jpg" />
<p>The above tree shows that the selected widget is a Treeview subwidget
in the TScrolledtreeview, that it is nested inside the toplevel
titled Example.</p>
<p>Remember that the Attribute Editor window displays the current
attributes of the Quit button. The Widget Tree is a very good place to
select a widget with Button-1.</p>
<p>If you change an attribute like the text in a button, the Widget tree
will not be updated until you hit the update button in the upper left
of the Widget Tree.</p>
<p>I frequently use this window to select the widget I want to modify and
occasionally it fails to select the widget, particularly when doing
copy and paste operations.  For unknown reasons,if I go and select
another widget and then reselect the widget I want, it usually works.</p>
<p>As described below in the section
<a class="reference internal" href="use.html#use"><em>Using PAGE</em></a>
is very important when trying to
move or select some of the more complex widgets like paned windows or
scrolled windows.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="bindings-window">
<h2>Bindings Window<a class="headerlink" href="#bindings-window" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This window which appears when Bindings is selected from the Widget
menu allows one to add one of the possible bindings shown for the
widget and to specify the action.  In the image below the event
&lt;Button-1&gt; has been added for a Button widget and &#8220;quit&#8221; is specified
for the action.</p>
<img alt="_images/binding.jpg" src="_images/binding.jpg" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="menu-editor">
<h2>Menu Editor<a class="headerlink" href="#menu-editor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>This window easily builds a menu.  You can see below an example of its
use.</p>
<img alt="_images/menu.jpg" src="_images/menu.jpg" />
<p>It is called forth from the Widget menus or from the Attribute
editor. I made this menu with weird colors and fonts to confirm that
such is possible.</p>
<p>There is one thing that is a little strange in the menu editor is that
colors like the background color is displayed on the button rather
than on the entry field.  I may try to run that down in a future release.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="function-editor">
<h2>Function Editor<a class="headerlink" href="#function-editor" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>I now, version 4.2,  consider this window to support the deprecated
function of programming functions within PAGE.  It is just plain
better to do that with a Python editor or IDE. See the section <a class="reference internal" href="use.html#defining-functions"><em>Defining Functions</em></a>.</p>
<p>Here is a list of the functions that have been defined for the
program. Obviously, the intended function in the original Visual Tcl
was to build Tcl functions. Such functions have no meaning for Python.
The best place to define your Python function is in the Python IDE
that you are using. However, this facility does serve a purpose.  It
allows you to easily build a skeleton function that are called when
you try a test run of the GUI.  More on that later.</p>
<img alt="_images/function-list.jpg" src="_images/function-list.jpg" />
<p>If one selects the left button in the function list, the Function
Editor appears.</p>
<img alt="_images/function-editor.jpg" src="_images/function-editor.jpg" />
<p>This is already set up with a skeleton python function named py:xxx. If
you then go into the editor and change xxx to the name of the function
that you may have specified in a menu, binding, or command attribute,
you get the dummy Python function that will be needed to test the
GUI. When you have your GUI window and are back in the Python IDE
fleshing out your application, then complete the skeleton functions.</p>
<p>Class methods are distinguished by having the &#8220;self&#8221; as the first
parameter.</p>
<p>The more I use PAGE the less that I use the function editor.  The IDE
that I use to create the python functions in emacs.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="preferences-window">
<h2>Preferences Window<a class="headerlink" href="#preferences-window" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The Preferences Window allows one to set some PAGE preferences.
I considered removing the Preferences Window completely, but on
further thought I realized that the this is indeed a complex subject
involving preferences for both PAGE and the GUI generated by
page. Please see the section on         <a class="reference internal" href="preferences.html#preferences"><em>Defaults and Preferences</em></a>.</p>
<p>The Colors tab of the Preferences Window is shown below.</p>
<img alt="_images/colors.png" src="_images/colors.png" />
</div>
<div class="section" id="python-console">
<h2>Python Console<a class="headerlink" href="#python-console" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>When the user generates the python module as described above the
Python console window appears with the generated code inside the upper
text box. It has the following appearance:</p>
<img alt="_images/console.jpg" src="_images/console.jpg" />
<p>The upper text box contains the generated text with a bit of
colorization applied. The lower text box contains any generated output
from running the source program. The Python Console is a
ttk::panedwindow which allows one to move the sash between the two
text boxes.</p>
<p>To execute the generated Python module, just click on the Run button
of the &#8216;Python console&#8217;.  Unless you have written the necessary
functions not much will happen other than providing a preview of the
GUI. In version 3.5, I have modified the skeletal function that are
generated automatically for callbacks to print the function name in
the Execution Output window using the Print function.  On Linux or OS
X the function name will appear immediately; on Windows, when
execution is terminated.  The Print function works fine for Python 2.7
or 3.x. See the penultimate paragraph of this section which discusses
this more.</p>
<p>There are several buttons along the bottom of the window. They behave
as follows:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Save - Saves the contents of the upper text box into a file. It also saves the tcl files.</li>
<li>Run - Attempts to execute the source module in the upper text
box. It also saves the Python and the tcl files.</li>
<li>Close - Closes the Python console.</li>
</ul>
<p>The upper text box can be modified (edited) by selecting a character
position with the mouse and typing. Such changes will be saved with
either the Save or Run buttons.</p>
<p>As you can imagine the colorization is not fancy. Keywords, comments,
and strings are set to distinct colors. The defaults are set to
reasonable colors for light backgrounds. One place you may have
trouble is with quotes that bracketed by &#8216;&#8217;&#8217; or &#8220;&#8221;&#8221;. You should start
a line with one of these delimiters and end a following line with one.</p>
<p>The Run Button attempts a trial run on your GUI. If you have enough
skeleton functions and there are no errors in the generated code, you
should see the python code executed and the GUI window will
appear. From there you close the Python window go back to PAGE and
refine the GUI by moving widgets around, adding additional widgets,
or changing attributes.</p>
<p>A problem was reported when users attempt to resize the
window. Changes made in PAGE 3.1 allow the window to gracefully
resize. This can be necessary if the screen resolution will not allow
the entire window to be displayed. When the window is made smaller, it
may appear to loose the Execution pane. However, it can be recovered
by moving up the sash of the paned window.  When one quits and
restarts PAGE after resizing the Python console, the new size will
have been saved in ~/.pagerc and used when subsequently invoking the
Python console including the placement of the sash. So invoke the
Python console, resize it, re-position the sash quit PAGE, and restart
PAGE to use the new Python console.</p>
<p>Also, scroll wheel support in the Python console has been updated in
PAGE 3.1.  To use the scroll wheel in Windows one must focus
on the desired pane first.</p>
<p>In earlier versions, the output from the execution was written to a
file and then displayed in the bottom pane when execution
terminated. With version 3.5, the Python execution on Linux now
communicates with the console through pipes; thus output from the
execution now appears immediately in the Execution Output pane.
Coupled with a recent change which embeds a print statement in the
generated dummy functions, if a user specifies a command for a button,
for example, and generates the python and runs it from the Python
Console, and selects the button, the name of the command will appear
in the Execution Console.
This is useful because no output from selecting the widget means that
you have not defined a callback function. Unfortunately, on Windows
the name of the command does not appear until the execution
terminates.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="color-dialog">
<span id="id1"></span><h2>Color Dialog<a class="headerlink" href="#color-dialog" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>There are many cases where when setting preferences in the Preferences
window or attributes for a widget in the Attribute Editor one selects
a little button with an ellipsis and the invokes a color dialog window:</p>
<img alt="_images/colorpicker.png" src="_images/colorpicker.png" />
<p>When this window pops up you are given several different ways of
selecting a color:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Pick a color in the multicolored window with your mouse.</li>
<li>Enter values in the Red, Green, and Blue entry fields.</li>
<li>Enter values in the Hue, Saturation, and Value entry fields.</li>
<li>Enter an Hex color value such as #f5deb3 in the Color entry field. That is the color wheat.</li>
<li>Enter a color name such as wheat in the Color entry field.</li>
</ul>
<p>I found the color dialog on the web at <a class="reference external" href="http://http://jack.r.free.fr/index.php?lng=en&amp;page=colordlg">Le site de Jack</a>.
It was very easy to use and allowed me to enter color names, a feature
not allowed by the other color pickers I found.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="colors">
<h2>Colors<a class="headerlink" href="#colors" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Since PAGE is aimed at using ttk widgets which will obey the canned
themes which are basically black on gray, I want the background of
created windows to be gray.  Unless you are prepared to work with
themes, I recommend that you stay with the tk default colors.</p>
