	This example contains an application where the main program,
main.py, displays a GUI with two buttons, the interesting one of
which cause another GUI defined in caller.py to be created twice.

	In interesting aspect of this example is the passing of user
parameters to the create function in caller.py which in turn is passed
on to the init function in caller_support.py.  Thereby cloning itself.


    When you are building applications with multiple simultaneous
instances of one GUI, it may be necessary to use class functions and
as well as Tk variables designed within the GUI class.  Both of these
can be done by prepending "self." to the class function or Tk variable
name.  In this example you will note that I used the lambda operator
to pass parameters to functions in the support module.
