<p>With version 4.2, I turned my attention to facilitating rework in
PAGE.  That is, how do you use PAGE to tweak the GUI without loosing
the supporting code that you have written? At the same time I want to
allow one to view the changes with the run command button in the
Python console.</p>
<p>Here is the situation.  You built a GUI and generated the Python file,
which created skeleton functions in that file.  You then fleshed out
the skeleton functions to support the GUI and then decided to modify
the GUI.  If then you again generate the Python code for the GUI, you
will have replaced the filled-out functions with new skeleton
functions loosing the code you wrote.  This is the rework problem: How
to save your hard fought code when reworking the GUI.</p>
<p>What needs to be done is to separate as completely as possible the
automatically generated GUI code from the added support code.  I have
made some changes that move in that direction in version 4.2.</p>
<p>My answer is to separate the generation of the GUI code from the
supporting code by placing the support portion of the automatically
generated code into a separately generated module to be imported by
the GUI module.  That is, now PAGE generates two modules, one for the
GUI and one for the supporting code complete with the necessary
linkage.</p>
<p>PAGE implements this schema as follows. Heretofore, a GUI built with
PAGE was associated with two files, &#8220;&lt;name&gt;.tcl&#8221; which is the file
suitable for input to PAGE, and &#8220;&lt;name&gt;.py&#8221; which is output of PAGE
containing the Python code for creating the GUI object and skeleton
functions and Tkinter variables utilized by the GUI. In the new scheme, the
skeleton functions and Tkinter variables are generated in the new file
&#8220;&lt;name&gt;_support.py&#8221; rather than in &#8220;&lt;name&gt;.py&#8221;.  A new item, Generate
Import Module, has been added to the Gen_Python submenu of the main
menu which generates &#8220;&lt;name&gt;_support.py&#8221;.  The new support file is
presumably only generated once and is where the bulk of the code
realizing the application is written. &#8220;&lt;name&gt;&#8221; is the application name
selected by the user when the system saves the &#8221;.tcl&#8221; or extracted
from the file name which may be supplied when invoking PAGE.</p>
<p>Thus, one may alter the &#8220;&lt;name&gt;.py&#8221; using PAGE without changing the
&#8220;&lt;name&gt;_support.py&#8221;.  Of course, if the user changes the GUI and refer
to new callback functions or Tkinter variables, then those will have to be
manually added to the support module. The style of the skeleton
functions and TK variable additions is pretty simple so that they are
easy to add manually.</p>
<p>Let me repeat: You should only generate the support module once; otherwise
any code which you added will be lost.  Well, just in case you do that
inadvertently, PAGE will save some previous versions as backups.  If
you add new features specifying new callback functions or new Tk
variables you will have to add them manually to the supporting module.</p>
<p>See the WCPE directory in the examples directory.  This is a program
that displays the program of WCPE which is one of my favorite
classical music stations.  In this example all of the functional code
is located in WCPE_support.py and the GUI is defined in WCPE.py which
is the main module.  I found it very tricky to deal with time zones
and did not want to loose any of that code and have to redo it or to
deal with diff&#8217;s ; at the same time, I was constantly tweaking the
GUI.  I generated the import module once and proceeded fill out the
init function and the callback functions in WCPE_support.py while
tweaking the GUI, i.e., changing its location, color, the size of the
display fields, etc..</p>
<p>Also, in the examples directory, you should compare the progress_bar
and the rework_progress_bar.  The directory rework_progress_bar
contains the changes that I made to the files in progress_bar to
conform to the new rework scheme. It may be instructive in that it
exemplifies an application comprised of two top level windows where
one of the windows accesses Tkinter variables in the second window.</p>
<p>With chagrin, I apologize to PAGE user for not having thought of this
solution to rework long ago.  Even though I have tested the idea with
several examples, some of which are included in the section on
examples, I worry that I have overlooked something big.  So if you
find any problems or oversights, please let me know.</p>
