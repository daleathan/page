Vrex is a python program built using PAGE.  It is a visual debugger
for regular expressions.  I think it is a fine example of a useful
program that can be whipped out with PAGE.  Just execute vrex.py and hit
the help button to get started.

Dependencies of this program are:


		  python2.7

or 

          python3.2



The main file is vrex.py and the support file is vrex_support.py. See the 
rework section of the PAGE manual.  In order to open the Help GUI, vrex.py 
invokes the create function in vrex_help.py which in turn imports and utilizes
vrex_help_support.py.

In addition there are files which contain (1) an example regular expression, 
and (2) a single line sample and a multiline sample. These files can be loaded
from the menu.

Because this example is written following the guidelines described in rework 
section of the manual, you can experiment with the PAGE source files vrex.tcl
and vrex_help.tcl without producing the supporting code.


The file vrex.html is a users guide for vrex.
