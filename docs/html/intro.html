<h1>Introduction<a class="headerlink" href="#introduction" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h1>
<p>PAGE is a tool which helps to create Tkinter GUI interfaces for use
within Python programs.  It is a rework or extension of the program
Visual Tcl (Vtcl) so that Vtcl now produces Python code. Faced with
the problem of building an application requiring a single GUI window,
PAGE will facilitate designing the GUI window and building a working
skeletal Python program emphasizing the ttk widgets. As other windows
are required, they are designed with PAGE and incorporated into the
application by importing the generated python modules.</p>
<p>It is aimed at a user who wants to rapidly construct a GUI and is
willing to compromise generality for ease and speed of construction.
It is a helper tool. It does not build an entire application but
rather is aimed at building a single GUI window.  It is not a Python
Interactive Design Environment(IDE). Stated in other words, PAGE
generates a Python class which implements a single GUI window and also
supplies all of the boiler-plate code for execution or instantiating
the GUI object. If, like me, you have difficulty remembering all the
little tricks of getting a GUI to show up on the screen, PAGE can show
you code that will work.</p>
<p>When I first set about building programs that exploited Tkinter, I
could not find nearly enough examples. Another way of looking at PAGE
is to consider it to be a Tkinter example builder which can build the
examples you need to see.</p>
<p>The author is Donald Rozenberg and project page for PAGE is

<div class="section" id="change-history">
<h2>Change History<a class="headerlink" href="#change-history" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The 3.0 release was a major revision of PAGE initiated because of the
following events:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>The release of Tcl/Tk 8.5 which includes the ttk widget
set. This is a themed widget set containing new core widgets
such as notebook, combobox, treeview and progressbar widgets.
Further, the themed feature allows the same design look natural
on Linux, Windows, and OS X.</li>
<li>The advent of a new version of Visual Tcl upon which PAGE is
built. The new version provides an improved user interface.</li>
<li>I have realized that some of the bells and whistles that I
included before are superfluous or perhaps error prone.</li>
<li>Although relative placement was incorporated in the previous
version, it added to the desirability of making a major
revision because some Tix widgets had some problems when
stretched. I want to thank George Tellalov for his suggestions
and encouragement regarding this feature.</li>
<li>The Pyttk package by Guilherme Polo showed me how to create
scrolled versions of text boxes and list boxes in a very
transparent manner.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>Thus, a fairly complete set of widgets is now supported without
recourse to the Tix package or other packages, resulting in a great
simplification of the installation process, particularly installation
on Windows.</p>
<p>The 4.0 release contains sufficient advances including:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Significant improvements in the specification and clarity of Preferences.</li>
<li>Significant work with color and associated connections with styles.  Emphasis on readability of generated style code. Unfortunately, this seems to work better with Linux/Unix systems than with Windows or OS X.</li>
<li>Better support for OS X.</li>
<li>Better support for the Scale and TScale widgets.</li>
<li>Better support for Toplevel widgets. You can now change attributes; background and cursor, for example.</li>
<li>Corrected problems with the TMenubutton.</li>
<li>Shifted emphasis to Python 2.7 from 2.6.</li>
<li>Added the ttk::sizegrip widget.</li>
<li>Fixed numerous bugs.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The 4.0.1 release incorporates bug fixes to font handling.</p>
<p>The 4.1 release contains several changes including:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Modified the GUI fonts preferences window to allow the user to specify Tk default fonts by name.</li>
<li>Changed the header of the generated Python to remove the python coding comment that seems to have caused some problems.</li>
<li>Changed the import statement in the boiler plate code of the Python GUI to look a bit more elegant.</li>
<li>When Python GUI code is generated, several existing versions are saved with the added extension &#8221;.bak&#8221;. Five existing versions will be saved.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The 4.2 release has new function which aids <a class="reference internal" href="rework.html#rework"><em>Rework</em></a>.  This is a
fairly extensive departure from the previous workings of
PAGE. Additional examples were added to illustrate some aspects of the
rework scheme.</p>
<p>The 4.2.2. release adds a Help menu to the main menu and can open the
html documentation in the default browser.  Also, some window titles
have been cleaned up.</p>
<p>The 4.2.3 release corrects the bugs with saving files and makes that process more regular.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="review-of-x-window-concepts">
<h2>Review of X Window Concepts<a class="headerlink" href="#review-of-x-window-concepts" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Let me review some X window definitions and concepts in order to
avoid confusion with the terms used here, including top-level
window. Some of this information is taken from &#8220;Tcl and the Tk
Toolkit&#8221; by John K. Ousterhout. &#8220;The X Window System provides
facilities for manipulating windows on displays. ... Each screen
displays a hierarchical collection of rectangular windows, starting
with a &#8216;root window&#8217; that covers the entire area of the screen. The
root window may have any number of child windows, each of which is
called a &#8216;top-level window&#8217;.  An X application typically manages
several top-level windows, one for each of the application&#8217;s major
panels and dialogs.&#8221; One can also speak of an application&#8217;s &#8216;root&#8217;
top-level window. This is the terminology from Grayson&#8217;s book. John
Grayson&#8217;s &#8220;Python and Tkinter Programming&#8221;, Manning, 2000</p>
<p>In building a multi top-level window example, I recommend that one use
PAGE to build the &#8216;root&#8217; top-level window and then use the
corresponding generated Python module as the basis for the main module
of the application. When one needs additional top-level windows, use
PAGE to specify them and use that code as additional modules for the
application which can be imported as needed. They will contain
automatically generated functions for creating and destroying them
within the modules.</p>
<p>When one feels confident in using PAGE, he looks at the code patterns
generated by PAGE and modifies the code for effects not anticipated in
PAGE. The thought behind PAGE is that there is a large and
intimidating body of information needed to start building a GUI and
getting it to actually appear on the screen. PAGE encapsulates that
information and produces working code. At that point the user can see
and understand the code patterns and can easily customize and extend
the code.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="visual-tcl">
<h2>Visual Tcl<a class="headerlink" href="#visual-tcl" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>PAGE is based on Stewart Allen&#8217;s Visual Tcl program. In fact, it is
vTcl, with modifications and an additional module that generates
Python code. And yes, it is written in Tcl! Why not? Tcl is a great
language to have available on your machine. It has features which I
would like to see in Python. There are many great programs written in
that language.  Further, it leaves the door open to use the same
techniques for GUI builders in other languages which support Tk. The
disadvantage of using a Tcl implementation is that one is restricted
to widget sets which are available to both Tcl and Python. In previous
versions of PAGE, I supported Tix widgets to provide a comprehensive
widget set. With the arrival of ttk widgets in Tcl/Tk 8.5, I felt that
the ttk widget set was sufficient and dropped Tix.</p>
<p>PAGE is a modified version of Visual Tcl. Visual Tcl is a interactive
program for generating whole projects based on Tcl/Tk. Building PAGE, I
added the feature of also generating a Python program which realizes
the same GUI.  My changes were primarily to:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Add the modules which generates Python code.</li>
<li>Add support to Visual Tcl for the ttk widget set as well as scrolled
versions of several widgets like listbox, textbox, and treeview.</li>
<li>Aim the program to handle only one top level window.  I ditched
the whole project orientation.</li>
<li>Simplify the interface to only support the needs of one
building Python interfaces.</li>
<li>Write some documentation and comments for the program.
Documentation of Virtual Tcl is virtually nonexistent and that is
truly sad but all too common with open source programming.</li>
</ul>
<p>My changes have become so numerous that it is perhaps wrong to call it
merely a modification of Virtual Tcl.  I rather have begun thinking of
it as a fork which will probably be of little interest to the
maintainers of Vtcl nor should they be saddled with any responsibility
for the state of my version.  Since I have diverged so much from
Visual Tcl, I have decided to drop the Visual Tcl splash screen.</p>
<p>When one does a save in PAGE, it saves the constructed tcl
file which then can be used as an argument to PAGE allowing one to
modify or augment the GUI. Even more important, if PAGE screws up it
can be used to restart the process at the point where the GUI was
saved. So, save often.</p>
<p>The tcl file that is saved by PAGE is not an executable stand-alone
program in the usual sense or even the Vtcl sense.  It is of value only
for doing rework or recovery.  In retrospect, I see that I should have
used a file extension different from &#8221;.tcl&#8221; but it is probably too
late to change.</p>
<p>I was looking at different GUI generators for Tcl/Tk with a view of
converting the output of one to Python when I came across Visual Tcl
and the work of Constantin Teodorescu in generating Java from Visual
Tcl. I thought if one could automatically generate Java, it should be
even easier to generate Python.</p>
<p>I believe that Stewart Allen wrote Visual Tcl in the 1996-1998 time
period to aid in the development of Tcl/Tk applications. Constantin
Teodorescu modified vTcl to generate Java code using SWING as the
widget set. Looking at the Java generator convinced me to try doing
PAGE.  I was able to discern its behavior in spite of the nearly total
lack of documentation, usually finding an existing procedure when
needed.</p>
<p>Basically, I support only the placer geometry manager. In the past, I
worked with Visual Basic and the placer geometry manager seemed
comfortable and got me useful results. As further justification,
Constantin Teodorescu also limited the Java generation to the placer
geometry manager. It seems really natural with the drag and drop
paradigm. One disadvantage is that some of the sizes could be wrong if
fonts change. This is because several Tk widgets have sizing based on
font parameters. This has implications if the GUI is generated with
different fonts or resolution than are active during execution. There
may also be similar problems if the generated GUI is moved to other
platforms or environments.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="a-very-short-description-of-using-page">
<h2>A Very Short Description of using PAGE<a class="headerlink" href="#a-very-short-description-of-using-page" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>PAGE generates two Python files from a GUI specification.  The first
file is the code to create the GUI and is named &lt;name&gt;.py. All the
code in this file is generated by PAGE. The other file named
&lt;name&gt;_support.py contains the code that is necessary to complete the
function of the GUI.  It contains skeleton code for the callback
functions named in course of laying out the GUI, the definitions of
required Tkinter Variable classed refereed to in the GUI, and finally
the necessary linkage between the two modules.</p>
<p>A user begins by invoking PAGE using a script, &#8216;page&#8217; in linux.  You
get a new toplevel widget by selecting Toplevel in the Widget Toolbar
with Button-1. This toplevel widget is the GUI window. (In this
manual, I use the terms Button-1 and Button-3 rather than left button
and right button because a user may be using a left handed mouse. This
is consistent with Tcl documentation.)</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Using Button-1 on the mouse, drag the toplevel window to where you
want it and resize it appropriately. Change attributes such as
title as desired using the attribute editor.</li>
<li>Select a desired widget from the Widget Toolbar with Button-1 and
place it within its parent by clicking Button-1 within the
parent. One can then use the mouse to move and resize the widget
(For some of the complex widgets, one has to press the control key
along with Button-1 to select the entire widget.) Using the
Attribute Editor then change any of the attributes of the widget
including the names of callback functions. It is probably a good
idea to provide an alias which will make the generated code easier
to read.</li>
<li>Repeat the above step (2) until the GUI is complete.</li>
<li>The remaining step is to generate the Python code in new python
files with the same root name based on the root name the &#8220;tcl&#8221;
file. This is done by selecting commands &#8216;Gen_Python&#8217; in the
submenu in the menu bar of the main window and generating the
Python code. Two Python files are required the Python file for the
GUI and the Python support module containing callback functions,
etc.. You will see a new window, the Python console where
the code can be expected to appear. Save the code. Execute the
code, if you have generated both the GUI module and the related
support module, to preview the GUI. It only shows the GUI, it is
not the complete application.</li>
<li>Create the necessary Python functions to realize the function of
the application.  PAGE will facilitate this by generating skeleton
functions for any functions named as callback functions in command
attributes. The second python file with the same rootname with
&#8220;_support&#8221; appended is also generated from the &#8220;Gen_Python&#8221; item in
the main menu. It will contain skeleton functions named as
callbacks in the GUI and definitions for Tkinter variables also
referenced in the GUI.</li>
</ol>
<p>With some Tk widgets, variables can be used with most entry widgets to
track changes to the entered value. The Checkbutton and Radiobutton
widgets require variables to work properly. Variables can also be used
to validate the contents of an entry widget, and to change the text in
label widgets. When using those widgets in Python-Tkinker programs it
is necessary to use &#8220;Tk Variable Classes&#8221; - BooleanVar, DoubleVar,
IntVar, and StringVar - which create variable wrappers that can be
used wherever Tk can use a traced Tcl variable. In this document I
refer to these classes as &#8220;Tkinter variables&#8221;. PAGE assists by
creating the definitions for the Tkinter variables as well as
instantiating the classes. See <a class="reference external" href="http://effbot.org/tkinterbook/variable.htm">effbot website</a> for additional
information.  PAGE attempts to help by supplying boiler plate to
define and instantiate the required classes.</p>
<p>When the code is saved or the File-&gt;Save is invoked, a Tcl file is
saved so that one can come back and modify the GUI. As of version 4.2
with its emphasis on rework, PAGE creates a supporting function
containing the skeleton functions, required Tkinter variables, and the
required linkages. See <a class="reference internal" href="rework.html#rework"><em>Rework</em></a> for details.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="status-of-page">
<h2>Status of PAGE<a class="headerlink" href="#status-of-page" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>PAGE supports many of the Tk widgets and many of the ttk widgets, other
widgets seem to be of lower priority to me; creating scrollbars and
linking them with text boxes and the like seemed to be confusing so I
skipped them in favor of auto-scrolled widgets like scrolled list box,
scrolled text box, and scrolled tree. Though not directly implemented in
the ttk widget set, Guilherme Polo in his Pyttk samples shows how to
easily implement them; therefore, they are included.</p>
<p>The supported widgets:</p>
<ul>
<li><p class="first">Standard Tk Widgets</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Toplevel</li>
<li>Frame</li>
<li>Message</li>
<li>Canvas</li>
<li>Entry</li>
<li>Listbox</li>
<li>Text</li>
<li>Checkbox</li>
<li>Radiobutton</li>
<li>Scale</li>
<li>Spinbox</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Themed Widgets</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>TButton</li>
<li>TCombobox</li>
<li>TEntry</li>
<li>TLabel</li>
<li>TLabel</li>
<li>TLabelframe</li>
<li>TMenubutton</li>
<li>TNotebook</li>
<li>TPanedwindow</li>
<li>TProgressbar</li>
<li>TRadiobutton</li>
<li>TScale</li>
<li>TSizegrip</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
<li><p class="first">Scrolled ttk widgets.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Scrolledlistbox</li>
<li>Scrolledtext</li>
<li>Scrolledtreeview</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
</li>
</ul>
<p>I have included Canvas in the above lists; however, I have never used
the canvas widget and do not fully understand its use or
programming. I am concerned that its programming is so general that I
cannot usefully help with PAGE.  It is there and Page will place a
canvas widget into your GUI.</p>
<p>One of the important features of the ttk widgets is the ability to
generate and modify themes.  Unfortunately, PAGE provides only
rudimentary facilities for manipulating themes. See a later section on
Styles and Themes.</p>
<p>As conceived Visual Tcl will save executable Tcl files which can be
opened from the file menu or specified as arguments. PAGE is trying to
generate Python code so the resulting Tcl/Tk files are not executable
but they definitely can be saved and loaded into PAGE for backtracking
to a previous state.</p>
<p>Knowing that I should have tested more, written more, and included
more widgets and more examples, I apologize.  If you come across bugs
or have comments please let me know and I will fix it if I can. I can
be reached at [don {dot} rozenberg {at} gmail {dot} com].  I have
mainly developed PAGE on linux but I have done some testing of PAGE on
Windows XP and on a Mac using Snow Leopard.</p>
<p>While it seems prudent to advise users to keep it simple, take a look
at examples/complex.py where I have paned windows nested inside pane
windows and a notebook nested inside a nested paned window.</p>
<p>For release 4.0, I spent about two months working with the &#8220;Theme&#8221;
part of Ttk and have had only partial success.  I now believe that the
&#8220;Theme&#8221; part of Ttk is really a very poor piece of software at all
levels - concept, implementation, and especially documentation. My
guess is if it had been well documented it would have been recognized
by even the author as junk. I find it hard to believe that the people
who control Tcl/Tk allowed it in the code base. I continue to support
ttk because of the paned window, notebook and treeview widgets.</p>
<p>With release 4.2, I have addressed the problem of rework, hopefully,
allowing easy tweaking of the GUI without jeopardizing custom coded
support functionality.  See <a class="reference internal" href="rework.html#rework"><em>Rework</em></a>.</p>
</div>
<div class="section" id="installation">
<h2>Installation<a class="headerlink" href="#installation" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>The required packages for PAGE are:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>PAGE 3.5 or greater - This is the GUI generator.</li>
<li>Tcl/Tk 8.5 or greater. - The is first version of Tcl/Tk to
contain the ttk widgets. I am using Tcl/Tk 8.6.1. Tcl/Tk is
required for executing PAGE. Tcl/Tk is required because PAGE is
written in Tcl/Tk.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>The package required for executing the python code generated by PAGE is:</p>
<blockquote>
<div><ul class="simple">
<li>Python 2.7 or greater. This version of Python includes the ttk
widget set.</li>
</ul>
</div></blockquote>
<p>One does not have to install Tcl/Tk or PAGE to execute programs
containing GUI&#8217;s generated by PAGE. All that is necessary is Python
2.7 which includes the ttk widgets.</p>
<p>Since Python 2.6 had its last release scheduled for October 2013, I am
now only supporting Python 2.7.3 which includes Pyttk.  I am also
recommending the ActiveTcl 8.6.1 package.  I would recommend that
anyone using a package you generate with PAGE be instructed to use
Python 2.7 of 3.2.</p>
<p>The installations that I am using place the directory containing PAGE,
named &#8220;page&#8221; into the users home directory.  This directory contains
the script &#8220;page&#8221;, which is executed to invoke PAGE.  The script
&#8220;page&#8221; is altered to reflect the locations of &#8220;wish&#8221; the Tk
interpreter, and the location of the PAGE directory.  This alteration
can be performed manually or by execution the &#8220;configure&#8221; script in
the PAGE directory.</p>
<p id="configure">The package contains the file &#8220;configure&#8221; which when executed will
create &#8220;page&#8221; a script for executing PAGE.  It is executed in the page
directory and its function is to:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Determine the full path for wish (first trying for wish8.6 and then
wish8.5) and embedding that path as a variable in the page script.</li>
<li>Setting the full path of the page directory as a variable in the page script.</li>
</ol>
<p>If it completes setting up both one can then copy the page script
anywhere in the file system and execute it.  It looks in just a few
places for wish and so may not find where you have installed it. It
does look in the default location for ActiveTcl-8.6
(/opt/ActiveTcl-8.6/bin). If it fails to find a version of wish that
has been installed on your system, then manually edit the page script.</p>
<p>With the release of PAGE 4.0, it is necessary to remove any &#8221;.pagerc&#8221;
which you may have because the new preference code may not work with
a &#8221;.pagerc&#8221; created with an older version.  Also, existing &#8221;.tcl&#8221; file
created with an older version of PAGE may not work.  At this point,
the release of version 4.0, I will only entertain bug reports which
can be recreated using Python 2.7, Tcl/Tk version 8.6, and PAGE 4.0+.</p>
<div class="section" id="installation-on-linux">
<h3>Installation on Linux<a class="headerlink" href="#installation-on-linux" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I am now running Mint 13 which including Python 2.7.3 and for Tcl/Tk
8.6.1. I am using the ActiveTcl distribution for Tcl/Tk. This is what
I recommend. Current Linux distributions like Ubuntu and Mint include
Python 2.7 and Tcl/Tk 8.5.  So I have installed  ActiveTcl-8.6.1 on my
system.</p>
<p>In the past I have found that building and installing both Tcl and
Python from source was quick and straight forward.  Just install
Tcl/Tk before building Python.</p>
<p>If you want Tcl/Tk 8.6.1, a good possibility is the ActiveState
binaries for Tcl, which is what I am using.</p>
<p>The steps for installing PAGE are:</p>
<ol class="arabic simple">
<li>Untar the distribution file in your home directory. You
can probably use &#8216;tar zxvf pageXXX.tgz. This will put all the
distribution in /page.</li>
<li>Run &#8220;configure&#8221; in the installation directory, it generates the
script &#8220;page&#8221; which can invoke PAGE.  You may want to insure that
the script &#8220;page&#8221; is in your execution path. If the script fails,
manually edit the version of the page script from the installation,
see <a class="reference internal" href="#configure"><em>configure command</em></a>.</li>

<p>With Version 4.2.2, it is now feasible to install PAGE in any
directory and have the icon start the program.  This has been tested
on a very old machine running XP.  The default directory for
installation is C:\page.</p>

<h3>Installation on OS X<a class="headerlink" href="#installation-on-os-x" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h3>
<p>I have not done much with PAGE on OS X.  However, several users,
including Kent Fox, have tried PAGE on OS X and have convinced me that
I should try to support PAGE on that system.  However, the
implementation of ttk with respect to color on OS X doesn&#8217;t seem very
satisfactory to me so I recommend sticking with default colors.</p>
