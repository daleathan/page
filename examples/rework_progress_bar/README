	This is a small example showing an application with two toplevel
windows, main and progress_bar.  It illustrates how the main routine
imports the code for the progress bar, creates the progress_bar
window, and controls when the progress bar is advanced. 


	This example is a redo of the example in progress_bar to show how I
changed the code in the progress_bar subdirectory to work under the
rework scheme.
